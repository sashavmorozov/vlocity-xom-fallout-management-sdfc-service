    <description>A template for notification on fulfillment case creation</description>
    <encodingKey>ISO-8859-1</encodingKey>
    <name>[Fulfillment] Fulfillment Case is Created (HTML)</name>
    <style>none</style>
    <subject>[Fulfillment] A new case was created for order {!Case.Order__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Fulfillment case is created.

Something went wrong while we were fulfilling the order {!Case.Order__c}. One of the tasks in the process fatally failed and now needs a boost from a human expert.
